# Data-Analytics-and-Data-Science-Projects
Contains all the projects completed during my learning process of data science with python. This invloves projects for numpy,pandas, data visualization
with python and completeing two capstone projects to check my skills in the same.
Along with that i have done prejects for learning machine learning with python, which involves learning about various models and learning about these models
and how to train them.

I have also attached all the necessary csv files for the data for most of the projects. Some projects require data to be directly taken form google or
kaggle, so it has been mentioned as such in the python notebooks.
